# Tinerary - Travel Itinerary Planner

A minimal travel itinerary planner built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. Currently a work in progress with most functionality still broken.

## Current State

⚠️ **Work in Progress** - Most features are currently broken or incomplete:

- Trip creation form works but doesn't save data
- Trip page UI is implemented but functionality is broken
- API routes are set up but not connected to a database
- Many UI components are missing or not working properly

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Features (Planned)

- Create and manage travel itineraries
- Add days and activities to your trip
- Share trips with friends
- Export trips as PDF
- Beautiful, minimal UI with dark mode
